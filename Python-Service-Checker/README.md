<b><h3>Service Checker:</h3></b>

This script will check any service that you would ask, and show you the average of his CPU usage and RAM usage.

By the correct usage of this script you can show only the CPU or the RAM,<br>the correct usage is:
  
  <h5>* To show the CPU and RAM:./service_checker --service <SERVICE_NAME></h5>
  <h5>* To show only the CPU average: ./service_checker --service <SERVICE_NAME> --cpu</h5>
  <h5>* To show only the RAM average: ./service_checker --service <SERVICE_NAME> --ram</h5>
      
      
The next version of the script will be more dynamic and will show statistics about all services<br>based on usage history.
